I am a $4^{\text{th}}$ year economics PhD candidate at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/), under the supervision of [Luc Behaghel](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/behaghel-luc/behaghel.htm). My research interests lie in both econometrics and labor economics. 

My work in econometrics is mainly focused on developing efficient estimation and inference methods for causal parameters (in particular, [the LATE parameter](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951620)). 

In labor economics, I am studying the efficiency of public policies (e.g., tailored job search counseling and training programs) in fostering occupational transitions.

Prior to that, I obtained an undergaraduate degree in economics from [PSL University](https://www.psl.eu/en), and a master's degree in economics from the Paris School of Economics while studying at the [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en).
