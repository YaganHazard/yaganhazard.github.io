I am a $4^th$ year economics PhD candidate at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/). My research interests lie in both econometrics and labor economics. My work in econometrics is mainly focused on developing efficient estimation and inference methods for causal parameters (in particular, [the LATE parameter](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951620)).
