I am an Assistant Professor at the Collegio Carlo Alberto and the University of Turin.

My research interests lie in both econometrics and labor economics. I am on the academic **job market** in 2022. My work in econometrics is mainly focused on developing efficient estimation and inference methods for causal parameters (in particular, [the LATE parameter](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951620)). Beside this research agenda, I have strong interests in labor economics. I am particularly interested in measuring the effectiveness of public policies (e.g., tailored job search counseling and training programs) to guide and foster occupational transitions.

I received my PhD in Economics from the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/) in september 2023. Prior to my PhD, I obtained an undergaraduate degree in economics from [PSL University](https://www.psl.eu/en), and a master's degree in economics from the Paris School of Economics and the [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en).

On a more personal note, my way of preserving enthusiasm for my work (and also quite frankly, simply enjoying myself) is mainly through sport climbing and trail running with friends!
