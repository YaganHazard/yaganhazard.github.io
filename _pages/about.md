I am an Assistant Professor at the Collegio Carlo Alberto and the University of Turin (ESOMAS).

My research interests lie in both econometrics and labor economics. My work in econometrics is mainly focused on developing efficient estimation and inference methods for causal parameters (in particular, [the LATE parameter](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951620)). Beside this research agenda, I have strong interests in labor economics. My work in this area focuses on measuring the effectiveness of public policies (e.g., tailored job search counseling and training programs) to guide and foster occupational transitions.

I received my PhD in Economics from the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/) in september 2023. Prior to my PhD, I obtained an undergaraduate degree in economics from [PSL University](https://www.psl.eu/en), and a master's degree in economics from the Paris School of Economics and the [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en).

On a more personal note, my way of preserving enthusiasm for my work (and also quite frankly, simply enjoying myself) is mainly through sport climbing and trail running with friends!
