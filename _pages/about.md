I am a $4^{\text{th}}$ year economics PhD candidate at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/), under the supervision of [Luc Behaghel](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/behaghel-luc/behaghel.htm). My research interests lie in both econometrics and labor economics. I am on the academic **job market** in 2022.

My work in econometrics is mainly focused on developing efficient estimation and inference methods for causal parameters (in particular, [the LATE parameter](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951620)). Beside this research agenda, I have strong interests in labor economics. I am particularly interested in measuring the ability of public policies (e.g., tailored job search counseling and training programs) to foster occupational transitions.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained an undergaraduate degree in economics from [PSL University](https://www.psl.eu/en), and a master's degree in economics from the Paris School of Economics while studying at the [Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en).

On a more personal note, my way of preserving enthusiasm for my work (and also quite frankly, simply enjoying myself) is mainly through sport climing and trail running with friends!
