**Improving LATE estimation in experiments with imperfect compliance: selecting instruments with $1^{\text{st}}$ stage heterogeneity and heterogeneous treatment effects** (with S. Loewe). Draft coming soon.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('improve-late')">More</a> ] </small>

<div id="improve-late" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
**Research question**: Can we construct an estimator of the LATE with lower variance when there is first-stage heterogeneity along observable covariates, and treatment effect heterogeneity is of the order of magnitude of sampling variation ($\small O(1/\sqrt{n})$)?<br/><br/>

**Advancement**: Existing preliminary draft. Presented in PSE-CREST internal econometrics seminar and Brown Econometrics Coffee seminar. Simulations of the method demonstrated its potential for the improvement of inference on LATE in certain contexts, as well as the need for some careful use of data splitting and cross-fitting in order to avoid severe bias in finite samples.<br/><br/>

**Plan**: Working paper to be released soon.

**Bias-aware inference on LATE with bounded treatment effect heterogeneity** (with X. D'Haultfoeuille and S. Loewe). <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('bias-aware-late')">More</a> ] </small>

<div id="bias-aware-late" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Research question: In the spirit of the project "Improving LATE estimation ..." (with S. Loewe), yet with a focus on inference, and under the milder restriction of bounded treatment effect heterogeneity. This allows to consider bias-aware inference techniques, that have received a renewed attention in the recent econometric literature on treatment effect estimation.<br/>

Advancement: Project started in December 2021. Simulations applying the method are encouraging, showing the scope for improvement of inferential procedures in this framework.

**Empirical welfare maximization and optimal matching policies** (with T. Kitagawa). <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('EWM-opt-match')">More</a> ] </small>

<div id="EWM-opt-match" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Research question: Suppose a policy maker has to choose (based on quasi-experimental data) how to match two types of individuals (job seekers and caseworkers, students and teachers etc.) to maximize a given measure of output (job finding rate, grades etc.). How well would perform a decision rule that would implement the allocation with the highest possible output \textit{estimated from the sample} (compared to the \textit{actual} optimal allocation)? Such a decision rule is called \textit{empirical welfare maximization}, and earlier work by T. Kitagawa and A. Tetenov (2018) have already derive finite sample guarantees of its performance in finite samples for the choice of a binary treatment --- but not for the choice of an entire matching policy, as is the goal of this project. <br/>

Advancement: Project started in mid-March 2022.

# Labor Economics 

**Directing Job Search: A Large Scale Experiment** (with L. Behaghel, M. Gurgand, S. Dromundo and T. Zuber). Draft coming soon.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('lbb-job-search')">More</a> ] </small>

<div id="lbb-job-search" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Research question: Can we re-direct job search effort of job seekers towards firms with higher hiring prospects? What are the effects on job seekers finding rate? On firms' hiring behavior? We ran a large-scale experiment (800,000 job seekers) based on a job search online platform (La Bonne Boîte).<br/>

Advancement: Main experiment run in November 2019 (mailing 800,000 job seekers + randomizing firms' ranking on an major online platform's webpages). $1^{\text{st}}$ draft produced in March 2020. Selected for and presented in the Matching Workers and Jobs Online - 3rd IDSC of IZA/University of Luxembourg Workshop (September 2020). Selected and presented by myself in the 2022 North American Winter Meetings of the Econometric Society (January 2022).<br/>

Plan: Ongoing major revisions, new working paper to be released soon. Companion paper focusing on the effect on firms' hiring behavior to be drafted next (depending on ongoing analyses).

**Evaluating the effect of training programs on occupational transitions: a correspondence study** (with G. Azmat, L. Behaghel, R. Rathelot and J. Sultan).<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('CS-study-training')">More</a> ] </small>

<div id="CS-study-training" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Research question: To which extent can (short/long) training programs help in moving from slack to tight labor markets? In order to answer this question, we send firms fake CVs where we manipulate the occupation the applicant used to work in, and the type of training s/he has received related to the occupation firms are hiring in. <br/>

Advancement: Grant from Dares (EUR 289,656). Ongoing correspondence study (since December 2021). Preliminary results are encouraging, showing contrasts between the different versions of the CVs.

**Measuring occupational distances and the aggregate potential of training policies for labor force reallocation** (with D. Mayaux and T. Zuber).<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('occ-distance-training')">More</a> ] </small>

<div id="occ-distance-training" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Research question: How related are different jobs in terms of skills? To what extent training programs allow to move across jobs that differ in skills? How can this reduce the ``mismatch'' unemployment --- i.e., the unemployment due to unbalances in labor demand vs. supply across occupations?<br/>

Advancement: Grant from Dares (EUR 61,221). Research assistant skilled in computer sciences hired (since October 2021), working on text analysis of vacancy data in order to create indexes of ``skill distance'' across occupations.<br/>

Plan: In June 2022, we presented preliminary results of our analyses making use of the skill distance measures produced --- based on text analyses of vacancy data and dataset gathering Pôle emploi expert knowledge --- to describe the labor supply reallocations associated with training programs. Comparing such movements in relationship with labor market tightness measures, we aim to assess the extent to which public funded training programs contribute (in the aggregate) to the reduction of mismatch unemployment.

**Evaluating the effect of online training programs on employment: a randomized control trial** (with P. Arni, L. Behaghel, M. Gurgand, R. Rathelot and T. Zuber).<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('RCT-foad')">More</a> ] </small>

<div id="RCT-foad" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Research question: What is the effect of (online) training programs on the job finding rate and wages of job seekers? <br/>

Advancement: Grant from Dares (EUR 190,386). Pilot experiment launched in June 2022.<br/>

Plan: We will adapt the encouragement design based on the June 2022 pilot, and launch a full scaled experiment in September 2022. We will follow job seekers on the long run (6 months, 12 months, 24 months).
